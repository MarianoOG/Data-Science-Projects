# Streamlit Portfolio

This is a repository of several data science and data visualization projects. It's a work in progress that started as an exploration of a new tool (streamlit) but quickly transform in a simple way to create a portfolio. Usually I have the problem of not being able to show the work im able to produce due to NDA so this is some display of my work using public data.
